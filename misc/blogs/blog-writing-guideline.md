- **Lead Paragraph**: Start with a compelling case study, recent industry incident, striking statistic, or current technical challenge that immediately grabs attention and relates to reader's daily work
- **Context Statement**: Connect the topic to current industry trends, recent failures, or emerging opportunities that make this timely and relevant

**Main Content Structure:**
1. **Problem Definition** (100-150 words)
   - Start with a real field incident, documented failure case, compelling industry data, or current technical challenge that illustrates the problem (avoid repetitive "imagine" scenarios)
   - Connect to broader trends (renewable integration, grid modernization, reliability demands)
   - Include regulatory pressures or economic impacts that make this urgent
   - Use storytelling elements to make the technical problem feel immediate and personal
   - Write in paragraph form, not bullet points

2. **Technical Explanation** (300-500 words)
   - Use progressive disclosure: start simple, build complexity gradually
   - Include analogies or comparisons to familiar concepts when introducing complex topics
   - Break down into logical subheadings with engaging titles (e.g., "The Hidden Physics Behind CT Saturation")
   - Integrate Taehwatrans' experience subtly (e.g., "In our 30+ years of CT manufacturing, we've observed...")
   - Use storytelling transitions between technical concepts
   - Write primarily in paragraph form with occasional technical lists for specifications only
   - MUST include specific units, measurements, and quantitative data with context for why these numbers matter
   - MUST cite relevant IEC/IEEE standards with specific numbers (e.g., IEC 61869-2) and explain their practical significance

3. **Practical Application** (200-400 words)
   - Use specific case studies, field experiences, or real project examples ("During a recent 138kV substation retrofit...", "Analysis of the 2023 grid failure revealed...", "Field data from 50+ installations shows...")
   - Include common pitfalls and how to avoid them, drawing from industry experience
   - Provide decision-making frameworks rather than just procedures
   - Add "pro tips" or insights that demonstrate deep practical knowledge
   - Connect back to business impact (cost savings, reliability improvements, compliance benefits)
   - Write in paragraph form, avoid excessive bullet points

4. **Industry Impact & Future Outlook** (100-200 words)
   - Connect to major industry transformations (renewable integration, digitalization, grid resilience)
   - Position Taehwatrans' technology/approach within broader industry evolution
   - Include forward-looking insights that demonstrate thought leadership
   - Reference recent industry developments, research, or emerging standards
   - End with implications for readers' work and strategic planning
   - Write in paragraph form

**Closing Section:**

- **Next Steps**: Actionable recommendations for readers

### Technical Content Guidelines

**Use These Elements:**
- **Subheadings**: H2 for major sections, H3 for technical subsections
- **Technical Lists**: ONLY for specifications, standards citations, and safety protocols - NOT for general explanations

- **Code/Standard References**: Always cite with specific numbers (e.g., "IEC 61869-2 Class 0.2S", "IEEE C57.13-2016")
- **Visual Descriptions**: Reference technical diagrams, circuit layouts, installation photos
- **Quantitative Data**: Include specific measurements (e.g., "Â±0.2% accuracy at 5-120% rated current", "insulation level of 72.5 kV")

**Avoid These Elements:**
- Marketing language or promotional claims
- Overly complex sentences that obscure technical meaning
